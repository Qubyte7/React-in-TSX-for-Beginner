                    -->>dataType2 : spesify what kind of data type our function gonna return


-------------------------------------redux-------------------------------------------------------

Redux provides a predictable state container,
 which allows you to manage and update application state in a more organized and maintainable way.
     ==>REDUCER:A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action, and returns the new state based on that action.
        --------
     ==>ConfigureStore: is a function that allows you to create a Redux store with sensible defaults and pre-configured middleware. You can pass in an object that contains the reducers that make up the store's state.
     ------------------
     ==>SLICE:this is the way of redux tool kit for automatically generate all of the different parts of our Reducer
     ---------
     ==>useSelector:The useSelector hook in Redux is used to extract data from the Redux store state in a React component. It allows you to select a specific piece of data from the store and use it in your component, without having to pass it down through props
     ---------------
     ==>dispacth:Dispatching refers to the process of sending an action to the Redux store using the dispatch function.
